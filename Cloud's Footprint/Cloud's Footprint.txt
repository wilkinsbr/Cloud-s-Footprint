Cloud’s Footprint

This ambient data display shows, through the frequency of flashing LED’s, the amount of power that the average human uses. The Cloud has two primary modes. The first mode has the red (streaming), blue (web), green (games), and yellow (social) LED’s go in a sequence. In this case, the number of times that each pair of colored lights flash per minuet indicates the average person’s Kw per day depending on the category. The second case has all the onboard LED’s flash simultaneously at a different rhythm. When in this mode, every “blink” indicates a Wh used per person on a timescale of 1 hour to 1 minuet. 

This display is intended to be viewed in an educational environment such as a museum or classroom, by children and young adults. As these two groups make up the majority of internet users, it is important for them to remember that the digital world has a physical impact.

A.

.06 kWh per GB (George Kamiya)

Q1 434.9
Q2 490.7
Q3 495.5
Q4 599.3

2020.4 GB per person per year average
5.53534247 GB per person per day 
5.53534247 * .06 (kWh per GB) --> .33 kWh per person per day



330 Wh per person per day

330/24 --> 13.75 per hour per person.

60/13.75 --> 4.36 seconds 

B.
330 Wh per person per day
3.3 Wh = 1%

Streaming = 61% --> 201.3 Wh per person per day
201.3/24 --> 8.3875 seconds --> .2980 seconds between blinks

Web = 18.7% --> 61.71 Wh per person per day
61.71/24 --> 2.57125 --> .9722 seconds

Games = 12.2% --> 40.26 Wh per person per day
40.26/24 --> 1.6775 --> 1.4903 seconds

Social = 7.7% --> 25.41 Wh per person per day
25.41/24 --> 1.05875 --> 2.35849 seconds
